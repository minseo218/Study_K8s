minseo@minseoui-MacBookPro ~ % brew install hashicorp/tap/hashicorp-vagrant     // install Vagrant 

minseo@minseoui-MacBookPro ~ % cd /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/hashicorp   // move to installation path

A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.

minseo@minseoui-MacBookPro hashicorp % vi Vagrantfile 
minseo@minseoui-MacBookPro hashicorp % vagrant up                              // vagrant could not find an image with the name 'base'
No usable default provider could be found for your system.

Vagrant relies on interactions with 3rd party systems, known as
"providers", to provide Vagrant with resources to run development
environments. Examples are VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V.

The easiest solution to this message is to install VirtualBox, which
is available for free on all major platforms.

If you believe you already have a provider available, make sure it
is properly installed and configured. You can see more details about
why a particular provider isn't working by forcing usage with
`vagrant up --provider=PROVIDER`, which should give you a more specific
error message for that particular provider.
